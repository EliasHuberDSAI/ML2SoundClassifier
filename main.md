The data that you will be using belongs to the urbansound8k dataset, which contains 8732 labeled sound
excerpts of duration less than or equal to 4 seconds. The sounds excerpts are labelled according to the
following 10 classes:
• air conditioner
• car horn
• children playing
• dog bark
• drilling
• engine idling
• gun shot
• jackhammer
• siren
• street music
The objective of this work will be that of building classifiers able to determine to which of the previous 10
classes a given, unseen, sound excerpt belongs to.
